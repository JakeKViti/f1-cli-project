# F1-Cli-Project

This project is designed to tell you about what years The Formula One World Drivers' Champions was competed for, what circuits they raced at, and users can find out what circuits were raced in any season of their choice. 


## Usage

 To start this program. Type `bin/project.rb` into your command line. From there, you will get steps on how to access data you want. `tracks` will let you see every circuit F1 has raced at. `years` will show you every year a World Drivers' Championship was competed for. `season tracks` will then prompt you for a year. Once you entered a year of your choice (Given that year falls between 1950 - To Current Year) you will see every circuit raced in that year. Finally `exit` will close out of the program
         

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
